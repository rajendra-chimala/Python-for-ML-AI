# Gradient : Rate of change intensity of pixel in particular direction.
# Edge : Heigh change rate of intensity is called edge.
# Sobel Method : Gradient based method that looks for strong changes int the first derivation. The Sobel edge detector uses a pair of 3 X 3 convolution makes one estimating the gradient in the x-direction and y-direction
