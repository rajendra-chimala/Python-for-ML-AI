# #Day49
# Continuing my AI & Machine Learning journey with Digital Pathshala, under the mentorship of Sir Samriddha Pathak, today I explored types of Machine Learning in depth.
# ðŸ”¹ Key concepts covered:
# âœ… Supervised Learning â€“ learning with labeled data.
# âœ… Unsupervised Learning â€“ finding hidden patterns without labels.
# âœ… Semi-Supervised Learning â€“ mix of labeled & unlabeled data.
# âœ… Reinforcement Learning â€“ learning by trial and reward.
# âœ… Built a small label-based ML model using Teachable Machine.

# ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway: Each ML type has its unique strengthsâ€”choosing the right one depends on the problem and the data available.
